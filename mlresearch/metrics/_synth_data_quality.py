    Parameters
    ----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    scorer_synth : function
        Method used to map a dataset into a score, or a 1-dimensional projection of
        itself. The mapping should be modelled over the synthetic dataset.

    beta : float, default=0.05
        Percentile used to determine the radius of the euclidean ball.

    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors to use by default for computing the radius for each sample
        in `X_real` for scoring. Ignored if `scorer_synth` is not `None`.

    metric : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "euclidean", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and

        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

        Ignored if `scorer_synth` is not `None`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. Ignored if `scorer_synth` is not `None`.
