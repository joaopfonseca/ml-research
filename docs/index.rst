Welcome to ML-Research documentation!
==============================================

``ml-research`` is a library that hosts much of the code written to conduct my
research. It contains the implementation of algorithms and research utilities:
dataset loading, experiment setup utilities, experiment results processing and
LaTeX tables formatting. The `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/joaopfonseca/ml-research>`_ also contains most of the source
code (LaTeX, Python, etc.) of all papers I have been involved with. They can
be found in the `publications directory
<https://github.com/joaopfonseca/ml-research/tree/master/publications>`_.
