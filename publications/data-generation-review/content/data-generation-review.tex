\begin{abstract}
    Over the past years, researchers have developed complex deep learning
    classifiers, which typically require a tremendous amount of data and
    computational power to train. Although, these resources are not always
    accessible to organizations, practitioners and researchers. Concurrently,
    current and past research have shown that simpler classification
    algorithms can reach state-of-the-art performance on computer vision tasks
    given a robust method to artificially augment the training dataset.
    Because of this, data augmentation techniques became a popular research
    topic in recent years, particularly among computer vision researchers. In
    this paper we identify the main areas of application of data augmentation
    algorithms, the main types of algorithms used, significant research
    trends, their progression over time and research gaps in data augmentation
    literature. This was done through using a network-based, text mining-based
    and exploratory analysis of literature collected through the Scopus
    database. We expect readers to understand the potential of data
    augmentation as well as identify future research directions and open
    questions within data augmentation research.

\section{Introduction}~\label{sec:introduction}

The performance of Machine Learning models is highly dependent on the quality
of the training dataset used~\cite{Fenza2021}. Specifically, the presence of
imbalanced and/or small datasets, target labels incorrectly assigned, outliers
and high dimensional input spaces reduce the prospects of a successful machine
learning model implementation. Even though the performance of any classifier
is affected by the size of its training dataset, deep learning models have a
particularly inconsistent performance over unseen datasets even when trained
with large datasets~\cite{Hu2020}. Conversely, deep learning models are
capable of quickly adapting (and overfitting) to the training dataset,
including when it contains label and/or complete pixel noise~\cite{Zhang2021}.
Although the performance of these models can be improved through
regularization methods, they are still incapable of correcting label noise in
the training dataset~\cite{Zhang2021}.

Regardless of the machine learning model used, when the training set contains
significant limitations (regarding overall quality and size), the model's
performance on unseen data is generally going to be affected. Specifically,
when the training data is not representative of the true population, or the
model is over-parametrized, it becomes particularly prone to overfitting.
There are different strategies to reduce overfitting, known as regularization
methods~\cite{Shorten2019}. Identifying the appropriate regularization methods
varies according to the use case \textbf{[REF]}. While some methods can only
be applied on specific classifiers or domains, others may be applied at the
data level, independently from the classification problem
\textbf{[REF]}. For example, methods such as dropout/dilution, batch
normalization and transfer learning/domain adaptation are mostly applied on
neural network architectures. Pruning is applied on decision trees. Early
stopping can be used on learners trained iteratively, making it a broader
method. 

Data augmentation techniques, on the other hand, are used to increase the
diversity of data in a training dataset through the production of artificial
observations \textbf{[REF]}. They are most frequently used as regularization
techniques for various types of problems and classifiers, since it is applied
at the data level \textbf{[REF]}. Figure~\ref{fig:data_augmentation_example}
shows an example of data augmentation, where the decision boundaries become
clearer after the original dataset is augmented. Data Augmentation methods can
be divided into heuristic and Deep Learning approaches~\cite{Shorten2019,
Ratner2017}. Within these approaches, they may be either domain specific or
contextually independent. For example, although both Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)~\cite{Chawla2002} and Kernel Filters are
heuristic approaches, SMOTE may be used regardless of the context, while
Kernel Filters are specific to image data augmentation. The different types of
Data Augmentation methods are defined at a higher detail in
Section~\ref{sec:data-augmentation}.

        where the amount data is scarce and the gap among the two classes are

        contains the augmented dataset, where the gap among the two classes is
        narrower and the decision boundaries become easier to define.
    }~\label{fig:data_augmentation_example}
\end{figure}

In 2011, Jürgen Schmidhuber's group showed that a MLP ensemble architecture
can achieve state-of-the-art performance on computer vision benchmarks given
strong enough data augmentation~\cite{Meier2011, Ciresan2011}. Although the
state-of-the-art improved since then, two recent papers developed by Google
Brain and Facebook research teams support Schmidhuber's group's findings.
Specifically, in~\cite{Tolstikhin2021, Touvron2021} the authors discuss two
similar MLP ensemble architectures, showing that the proposed model attains a
comparable performance to convolutional neural networks and attention-based
networks.  Another recent study also discusses a related MLP architecture with
similar findings, while suggesting that the strong performance of computer
vision models may be attributable mainly to the inducive bias produced by the
patch embedding and the carefully-curated set of training
augmentations~\cite{Melaskyriazi2021}.

\hl{However, Data Augmentation methods may be used on its own for different
purposes other than regularization. For example, Vector Quantised Generative
Adversarial Networks (VQGAN)}~\cite{Esser2020} \hl{is a Deep Learning approach that
became popular for the synthesis of art based on artificial intelligence
particularly when used along with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training
(CLIP)}~\cite{Radford2021}.

Research on data augmentation methods has gained significant popularity in
recent years. As such, there were some efforts in the past to establish a
taxonomy and distinction of the different types of data augmentations
methods~\cite{Shorten2019}. The most cited literature review on data
augmentation was focused on image data augmentation for deep learning,
published in 2019~\cite{Shorten2019}. Since then, research on data
augmentation methods have progressed significantly. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no analysis on data augmentation research as a whole, as
well as domains of application and future directions. In this paper we focus
on current and past research trends of data augmentation methods, its
different applications and use cases. This was done with an extensive analysis
of the title, keywords and abstract of a large set of literature related to
data augmentation, collected through the
\href{https://www.scopus.com/}{Scopus} database. The analysis was done in 3
phases. We started by performing an exploratory data analysis to identify the
most significant publications, journals and conferences within the field of
data augmentation. Then, we analyse the articles' author keywords by
constructing a network and extracting and identifying communities of keywords.
Finally we used a text mining approach to extract additional applications and
methods using the articles' abstracts, as well as validate the findings
discussed with the keyword analysis.

This paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:methodology} describes
the procedures defined throughout the different analyses.
Section~\ref{sec:results_discussion} presents and discusses the findings drawn
from the analyses, as well as research gaps and open questions in data
augmentation research. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the main
findings discussed throughout the study.

\section{Data Augmentation Methods}~\label{sec:data-augmentation}
 
Data Augmentation methods can be divided into Heuristic and Deep Learning
approaches \textbf{[REF]}. Heuristic methods use the information found in the
input space to generate new, relevant, non-duplicated observations by applying
a predefined set of rules, while incorporating a degree of randomness in the
generation process. Since data augmentation occurs in the input space, these
are cost-effective approaches to data augmentation. For this reason, heuristic
methods are simpler to implement and are particularly appealing for low
dimensional classification problems, especially when the computational power
available is limited. 

Deep Learning methods, on the other hand, attempt to map the original input
space into a lower-dimensional representation, known as feature space
\textbf{[REF]}. The generation of artificial observations occurs at the
feature space level, before being reconstructed to the original input space.
This is commonly done with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and
auto-encoder architectures~\cite{Shorten2019}.  Since data augmentation is
performed in the feature space, this type of approach is particularly useful
for high-dimensional data types and results in more plausible synthetic
observations~\cite{DeVries2017}. However, deep learning approaches require
more computational power than heuristic approaches and the resulting feature
space is difficult to interpret.

The difference in classification performance of the two perspectives is still
unclear. Wen et al.~\cite{Wen2020} evaluate the impact of data augmentation on
time series for various classification and forecasting tasks. Although they
found that both heuristic and deep learning approaches improved the results
over the various experiments, there was no direct comparison among the
different methods. Wong et al.~\cite{Wong2016} compared both input and feature
space data augmentation methods for image data classification performance over
the MNIST dataset. They found that input space augmentation can lead to better
classification performance if plausible transforms on the data are known.
However, in~\cite{DeVries2017} the authors discuss that the effectiveness of
each data augmentation method generally depends on the domain. The lack of
research on effective, domain-agnostic data augmentation methods appears to be
a current research gap.

\section{Methodology}~\label{sec:methodology}

In this section we describe the procedures defined for the literature
collection, data preprocessing and literature analysis. The analysis of the
literature was developed with 3 different approaches. Throughout the
analyses, data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning was developed
iteratively. The procedure adopted in this manuscript is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:slr_diagram}.

The literature collection procedure is described in
Subsection~\ref{sec:lit_collection}. The data and text preprocessing is
described in Subsection~\ref{sec:data_preprocessing}. The exploratory data
analysis described in Subsection~\ref{sec:journal_and_conference_analysis} was
done to understand which manuscripts, journals and conferences are most
significant within the field of Data Augmentation. The manuscripts' keywords
were used to construct a network of keywords (described in
Subsection~\ref{sec:keyword_analysis}) and study the different communities of
keywords found in the network. The topic modelling and parameter tuning is
described in Subsection~\ref{sec:topic_modelling}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{../analysis/slr_diagram}
    \caption{Diagram of the proposed literature analysis approach.
    }~\label{fig:slr_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Literature Collection}~\label{sec:lit_collection}

The focus of this literature analysis is to understand the different
algorithms, domains and/or tasks that employ data augmentation techniques.
Therefore, we search for documents containing the keyword ``data
augmentation'' in the search query. The results were then limited to
conference papers and journal articles written in English that were published
in the past 15 years.  Due to the large amount of results found, using solely
the \href{https://www.scopus.com/}{Scopus} database was found to be
sufficient. One of the goals during the search query design was to come up
with a simple and unbiased query. The resulting query is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
    KEY ( "data augmentation" )  AND  ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE ,  "English" ) )  
    AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE ,  "cp" )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE ,  "ar" ) )  
    AND (
            LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2021 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2020 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2019 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2018 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2017 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2016 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2015 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2014 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2013 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2012 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2011 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2010 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2009 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2008 )  
        OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2007 )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR ,  2006 ) 
    )  
\end{verbatim}

The search query resulted in 4281 documents. The resulting data
selection/filtering pipeline is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:data_filtering_pipeline}. Due to the limitations in the Scopus
data export (maximum 2000 documents per export), the data was split in four
different time periods and exported separately: 2006 until 2018, 2019, 2020
and 2021, which produced four CSV files.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}~\label{sec:data_preprocessing}

The data preprocessing stage and amount of documents dropped is represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:data_filtering_pipeline}. The data was first concatenated into
a single data frame. During this process, we found that one of the exported
references had a corrupted line, which caused the loss of one additional
document.  Since the DOI can be used as a unique identifier for intellectual
property~\cite{Paskin1999}, references without a DOI were disregarded from
further analysis, while the ones with the same identifiers are removed
(\textit{i.e.}, only one of the repeating entries is kept).

This dataset was kept to perform the analysis described in
Subsection~\ref{sec:journal_and_conference_analysis}. However, further
preprocessing was done for the remaining parts of the literature analysis.
References without any citations were excluded for the keyword network and
topic modelling analyses. Finally, only the documents containing keywords in
Scopus' database were used to prepare the network analysis.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=.55\linewidth]{../analysis/data_filtering_pipeline}
    \caption{Data filtering pipeline.
    }~\label{fig:data_filtering_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Journal and Conference analysis}~\label{sec:journal_and_conference_analysis}

The exploratory analysis developed on the preprocessed dataset was targeted
towards the identification of the most significant works, journals and
conferences. We used the citation count as a proxy to understand the impact of
a specific manuscript within the research community.

The identification of the most significant conferences and journals is done by
sorting each type of publication according to the number of citations per
document. Conferences and journals with less than 10 papers published in the
area are not considered in this analysis. 

\subsection{Keyword Analysis}~\label{sec:keyword_analysis}

The analysis of keywords is expected to uncover general trends in data
augmentation research and its applications. The keyword ``data augmentation''
was removed since it would link with all other keywords. Keywords are
connected based on their co-occurrence in each research paper to form the
edges of the network.  It consists of an undirected graph whose weights are
based on the total citation count for the papers containing a given keyword
pair and is calculated as $\textrm{weight} = \log(\textrm{citations}) + 1$ to
avoid a potential bias caused by highly cited research articles. The size of
the nodes were determined with a logarithmic transformation of each
node's page rank.

Keyword combinations showing up in only one document are removed from further
analysis. The keyword network is then analysed using Python and the
communities were found using the greedy modularity maximization algorithm
proposed in~\cite{Clauset2004}. The results of the analysis and community
detection were ported to Gephi to produce the final visualizations.

\subsection{Topic Modelling}~\label{sec:topic_modelling}

The extraction of topics was done using the publication's abstracts. The words
were tokenized and all tags, special characters, punctuation, multiple white
spaces, numeric values, stop words and words with size smaller than 4 were
removed. Finally, we enriched the corpus by constructing bi-grams and
tri-grams.

We used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model~\cite{Pritchard2000} to
infer the topics present in our research domain. The tuning of the parameters
was done through experimentation and qualitative interpretation of the results
achieved. Additionally, the coherence score curve was also used as a reference for
parameter tuning and the choice of parameters, which are described in
Table~\ref{tab:hyperparameters}. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Model   &   Hyperparameter  &   Value \\
        \midrule
        LDA     &   Num Topics      &   8     \\
                &   Chunk Size      &   2000  \\
                &   Passes          &   20    \\
                &   Alpha           &   0.1   \\
                &   ETA             &   auto  \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Hyperparameters used.}~\label{tab:hyperparameters}
\end{table}

\subsection{Software Implementation}~\label{sec:software_implementation}

The analysis and modelling was developed using the Python programming
language, along with the
\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{Scikit-Learn}~\cite{Pedregosa2011},
\href{https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/}{Gensim}~\cite{Rehurek2010}, and
\href{https://networkx.org/}{Networkx}~\cite{Hagberg2008} libraries. The final
network analysis and visualization was done with
\href{https://gephi.org/}{Gephi}~\cite{Bastian2009}. All functions,
algorithms, analyses and results are provided in the
\href{https://github.com/joaopfonseca/research}{GitHub repository of the
project}.

\section{Results \& Discussion}~\label{sec:results_discussion}

The popularity of research in data generation has grown significantly in the
past 5 years, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:area_chart_cited_documents}. Despite
the significant amount of uncited publications, out of the ones published in
2020, 39\% have already been used in other works. Although most of the
research developed before 2016 was used in other works, the amount of cited
research increased significantly after that period.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../analysis/area_chart_cited_documents}

        augmentation''.

\end{figure}

%\subsection{Terms Frequency}

\subsection{Journal and Conference Analysis}

The initial exploration of the bibliometric data allows us to assess which
journals focused in data augmentation more intensely over the past years, as
shown in Figure~\ref{tab:top_journals}. Most of the top journals belong to
technical fields, predominantly from Statistics, Remote Sensing, Medical
Imaging and other domains of applications such as agriculture. In addition,
all these journals have a high impact in their respective fields (based on 
\href{https://www.scimagojr.com/}{Scimago Journal \& Country Rankings}).

    }
\end{table}

Citation-wise, the publications coming from conference proceedings tend to
have a comparable impact in the research community, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:top_conferences}. The most relevant conferences are positioned
in the computer science and information management fields. Research developed
in other areas of application, such as computer vision, speech recognition,
acoustic modelling, natural language processing and signal processing have
more activity in the form of conference proceedings publications. Conversely,
the domains most frequent in journal publications are not as active on
conference proceedings publications.

\end{table}

The papers with the highest citation count are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:top_papers}. 
% Most of these papers are also discussed in Section~\ref{sec:theory}. 
We found that much of the research focused on improving deep learning
classification, segmentation or object detection without a focus on a
particular domain of application. Other papers centered in the application of
data augmentation methods for biomedical image classification and
segmentation, sound and speech recognition and remote sensing.

\subsection{Keyword Analysis}

The keyword network shown in Figure~\ref{fig:keyword_network} revealed 8 main
communities of keywords, and 13 other small communities. The different
communities are distinguished by the type of algorithms used and/or the domain
of application. The main distinctive factor for the larger communities are the
types of generative models used, while the smaller communities are
distinguished according to the domain of application. The most significant
findings we found from this analysis are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The community marked with pink-colored nodes is characterized by the
        usage of neural network-based data augmentation methods in
        convolutional neural networks. The keyword ``deep learning'' is
        positioned as a central node (although not labelled in the figure to
        maintain readability). Other relevant keywords are related to
        machine/deep learning frameworks, deep learning classifiers and data
        augmentation algorithms, such as ``tensorflow'', ``keras'',
        ``convolutional neural network'' and ``generative adversarial
        networks''. Domain specific keywords are also present:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Medical keywords located in this community cover a variety
                of applications. Relevant sub communities are [``hand
                writing'', ``parkinson's disease (pd)'', ``transfer
                learning''], [``breast cancer'', ``computer-aided
                detection''], [``melanoma'', ``skin cancer'', ``image
                processing'', ``googlenet''], [``chest x-ray'',
                ``computer-aided diagnosis'', ``tuberculosis'',
                ``segmentation''] and [``brain'', ``mri'', ``multiple
                sclerosis'']. 
            \item Remote sensing keywords are typically related to
                classification and object detection tasks. Relevant sub
                communities are [``object detection'', ``aerial image'',
                ``drone'', ``generative adversarial network'', ``semantic
                segmentation''], [``attributed scattering center (asc)'',
                ``synthetic aperture radar (sar)'', ``convolutional neural
                network (cnn)''], [``remote sensing'', ``road extraction'',
                ``transfer learning'', ``generative adversarial network''].
                Keywords such as ``hyperspectral imaging'' and ``weather
                classification'' are also scattered around the community.
            \item Facial recognition research is also represented in few sub
                communities: [``micro expression recognition'', ``small
                training data'', ``convolutional neural network (cnn)'', ``local
                binary pattern-three orthogonal planes (lbp-top)''] and
                [``training data augmentation'', ``sequence-to-sequence speech
                synthesis'', ``sequence-to-sequence speech recognition''].
            \item Fault detection studies also used data augmentation to deal
                with imbalanced datasets: [``fault diagnosis'', ``imbalanced
                data'', ``gan'']
            \item Data augmentation was also associated to regularization
                methods and feature extraction tasks, based on the presence of
                the sub communities [``overfitting'', ``dropout'' and ``cnn'']
                and [``feature extraction'', ``cnn'', ``svm''].
        \end{itemize}
    \item The community marked with blue-colored nodes is characterized by the
        usage of Markov Chain-based algorithms. The keywords ``markov chain'',
        ``data augmentation algorithm'' and ``monte carlo'' appear as central
        nodes. No application-specific sub-community was found.
    \item The community marked with green-colored nodes is characterized by
        the usage of Markov Chain and Bayesian-based algorithms. The keywords
        ``bayesian inference'', ``markov chain monte carlo'', ``mcmc'',
        ``bayesian analysis'', ``missing data'' and ``em algorithm''
        (expectation maximization algorithm). Application-specific keywords
        may be found sparsely distributed across the community, all of them
        related to biological applications. Specifically, the sub community
        [``ecological health'', ``stressor-response'', ``biological
        monitoring'', ``bayesian methods''] and the keyword ``camera
        trapping'' were found in this community. 
    \item The community marked with orange-colored nodes is characterized by
        keywords specific to big data and data warehousing applications. The
        network is composed of the keywords ``big data'', ``data lake'',
        ``olap'', ``map reduce'', ``cmm'', ``data warehouse'',
        ``augmentation'' and ``dm''.
    \item The remaining communities consist mostly of data augmentation
        methods applied to specific domains. Specifically, the usage of
        temporal-dynamic neural network architectures with ``eeg
        (electroencephalogram)'', music information retrieval applications
        (e.g., ``chord recognition''), speech/ speaker recognition and
        embedding, time series forecasting of diabetes and natural language
        processing and text classification.

\subsection{Topic Analysis}

The LDA topic extraction resulted in 8 different topics, whose distribution of
topics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lda_topics_sankey}. The main topics within
which most articles were included is topic 5, which is defined by the main
theoretical keywords related to image data augmentation. Rather, the secondary
topic is more useful for this analysis. It is found based on the topic
likelihood of each document, excluding the dominant topic. Documents belonging
to the same group across primary, secondary and/or tertiary topics had a
likelihood of zero of belonging to any other topic.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../analysis/lda_topics_sankey}
    \caption{Distribution of documents over the different topics found. The
        left column represent the primary topics, the middle column represents
        the secondary topics and the right columns represents the tertiary
        topics.
    }~\label{fig:lda_topics_sankey}
\end{figure}

The topics found in the bibliometric data are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:topic_analysis}. A few topics seem to overlap each other,
although they are generally distinguishable. The primary domains of
application of data augmentation methods differ for each different topic
identified:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Documents in Topic 1 frequently use the word ``yolov'', which refers
        to the YOLOvX family of deep learning object detection
        models~\cite{Redmon2015}, where X refers to the version of the model
        used (the most recent version is 5). Another relevant keyword is
        ``style\_transfer'', which refers to a specific technique of data
        augmentation. % (see Section~\ref{sec:theory}).

        This topic has two primary domains of application. The keywords
        ``pest'' and ``coffe'' refer to data augmentation on agriculture
        research. The keywords ``biomed'', ``histolog'' and ``nodul'' refer to
        biomedical applications such as pulmonary nodule detection and
        histology image classification. Within these topics, a few
        domain-specific data augmentation algorithms were proposed. For
        example, in~\cite{Cicalese2020} the authors propose a style-transfer
        data augmentation method for histology image classification.  

    \item Documents in Topic 2 are primarily associated to the study of
        applications that include image data augmentation. The dominant
        keyword, ``hyperspectr\_imag'', refers to the application of data
        augmentation on hyperspectral images, commonly used in remote sensing
        and medicine. Other classification tasks include license plate
        detection (``licens\_plate''), inpainting (``inpaint''), background
        subtraction (``illumin\_chang'') and cloud shadow
        detection/segmentation (``shadow'').
    
    \item Documents in topic 3 refer to the application of data augmentation
        to deal with censored data (a condition in which the value of an
        observation is only partially known) and/or supervised tasks on data
        structured as graphs. Other domains of application involve chest
        x-rays classification (``cxr''), epidemiology (``risk\_factor'') and
        few audio/music information retrieval (``sourc\_separ'') articles.

    \item Documents in topic 4 refer to the application of data augmentation
        methods on object detection tasks. Specifically fire and smoke,
        pedestrians and crowd counting. Other applications within this topic
        are focused on speech recognition and angiography
        segmentation/classification.

    \item Documents in topic 5 are focused on image segmentation
        and classification methods where data augmentation algorithms are
        involved. It includes common keywords present in a large set of
        articles. These articles are mainly focused on the development of
        different convolutional neural network architectures (``cnn'') and
        neural network-based data augmentation methods.

    \item Documents in topic 6 are focused on Bayesian-based algorithms and
        Markov Chain algorithms. This topic includes data augmentation on
        regression tasks and misclassification detection.

    \item Documents in topic 7 covers the application of data augmentation
        into various domains. Specifically, music information retrieval
        (``music''), fish/marine organisms recognition, gender bias, speech
        recognition, random erasing 

    \item Documents in topic 8 contains remote sensing and biomedicine as the
        primary research domains. The keywords ``drone'' and ``aircraft''
        refer to the sources of data collected for remote sensing work,
        whereas ``pneumonia'' and ``chest\_rai\_imag'' refers to biomedicine
        research topics/image data.

The per-year popularity of the different topics is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:topics_per_year}. Since 2015, topic 5 gained more research
momentum, whereas topic 6 lost much of its relative popularity within the
field. In the past 5 years topics 8 and 3 have become steady research streams
while topic 1 saw a significant growth in popularity.

\subsection{Research Gap Discussion}

Data augmentation mechanisms are often used as regularization methods for
deep learning classifiers. The study of data augmentation mechanisms in
ensembles of simple classifiers have achieved state-of-the-art performance not
only 10 years ago~\cite{Meier2011, Ciresan2011}, but also when compared to
modern deep learning architectures~\cite{Tolstikhin2021, Touvron2021,
Liu2021}. However, the implementation of different data augmentation methods
shows a promising path to improve the performance of simple classifiers
(and/or recent ensemble architectures) and requires further research.

A research application that was not frequently found in the literature was
small dataset augmentation. This is particularly useful for any complex
problem when the amount of labeled data available to use as training data is
scarce, which limits the usage of classification algorithms and especially
deep learning algorithms. In this context, techniques such as Active Learning
can be used to annotate a small amount of data, while maximizing the
classification performance~\cite{Su2020}. However, classifiers may not be
capable of generalizing with small training datasets and the ability to
reproduce and augment the labelled data available can further reduce
annotation cost and allow the usage of data intensive classifiers.

Another limitation found in the literature relates to the problem of
initialization on network-based data augmentation methods. The same data
augmentation algorithm trained with different initialization settings
(different random seed or training subset) may lead to different model
parameters and quality of the trained classifier.

The rapid development of data augmentation algorithms raises additional open
questions on how the data used and store for model training. Specifically, the
lower data storage and processing power available to the general public
(\textit{i.e.}, organizations and individuals) is a limitation for producing
state-of-the-art classifiers. Another problem arises from data privacy
concerns, since the usage of user data to train machine learning models
typically involve the storage of such information. However, if data
augmentation algorithms were continuously updated and capable of producing
reliable data on an as-needed basis, not only would storage requirements
decrease, but it would also become possible to work with fully artificial
data, without the need to store as much data. This would also facilitate the
sharing of datasets (in the form of an algorithm) without compromising
sensitive data.

\subsection{Study Limitation Discussion}

The design of the search query was done based on a single keyword. Although
this reduces possible bias, it may have been too broad and didn't include some
significant research papers from related techniques such as oversampling. The
design of the LDA analysis involved a significant amount of time spent on
parameter tuning.  Although, due to the subjectivity of the subject, the
results may benefit from a more extensive exploration of hyperparameters. 

\section{Conclusion}~\label{sec:conclusion}

Depending on the domain of application, data augmentation research differs in
the format of publication. On the one hand, domains like Statistics, Remote
Sensing and Medical Imaging seem more active on journal publications,
typically in journals with high impact factor. On the other hand, research
developed in the domains of computer vision, speech recognition, acoustic
modelling, natural language processing and signal processing seem to attribute
higher importance to conference papers. Many of the influential papers we found
were focused on deep learning methods for classification, segmentation, sound
and speech recognition and remote sensing.

We analysed the different communities of keywords formed using document
keywords, as well as topic analysis using a LDA analysis over the document's
abstracts. We found various distinctive areas of research, both regarding the
data augmentation methods used and the domain of application. We found that in
recent years research on augmentation methods using Bayesian-based algorithms,
as well as Markov Chain algorithms reduced its popularity, whereas data
augmentation methods based on neural networks and deep learning classifiers
have increased its popularity.

Data augmentation is most commonly applied/studied in the realm of computer
vision for tasks like image classification, segmentation, object detection
inpainting and background subtraction tasks, even though it may be applied to
many other data structures. It is frequently used in studies within the
domains of biomedicine, agriculture, speech recognition, acoustic modelling,
remote sensing and computational creativity. It is also used alongside other
data preprocessing techniques, such as feature extraction and dimensionality
reduction.

Although data augmentation is a vibrant area of research, there are still
significant gaps to be addressed. Data augmentation methods are increasingly
used as regularization methods for deep learning. Although, recent research
shows that the same can be done for simpler classifier configurations in order
to achieve a classification performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art
deep learning, which require further confirmation, as well as the development
of less computational intensive data augmentation methods. Other less popular
topics, such as small data augmentation, appear to have a relevant practical
importance and require further research. In addition, other limitations of
data augmentation algorithms should be addressed. One problem commonly found
in the literature is the impact the weights initialization and training set
used have in the quality of the trained algorithm. In the future, using data
augmentation methods as a source of artificial datasets can address a variety
of concerns, such as data privacy, sharing and storage. Finally, exploring
data augmentation algorithms to complement or replace techniques such as
Active Learning may reduce the cost of data collection, although it is yet to
be explored.
