## Abstract
People often turn to social media to comment upon and share information about major global events.
Accordingly, social media is receiving increasing attention as a rich data source for understanding
people's social, political and economic experiences of extreme weather events.  In this paper, we
contribute two novel methodologies that leverage Twitter discourse to characterize narratives and
identify unmet needs in response to Cyclone Amphan, which affected 18 million people in May 2020.
